                Backround Information: 
            </h2>

            <p>
                The BMW E46 is the fourth generation of the BMW 3 Series, which was produced from 1998 to 2006. 
                It is widely regarded as one of the best-handling and most well-rounded cars in its class, 
                offering a balance of performance, comfort, and practicality. The E46 was available in various body styles, 
                including sedan, coupe, convertible, and wagon, and it came with a range of engine options, including inline-four and inline-six engines.
                The M54 engine is a straight-six petrol engine that was produced by BMW from 2000 to 2006. 
                It was used in various BMW models, including the E46 3 Series, E39 5 Series, and Z4 roadster. 
                The M54 engine is known for its smooth power delivery, high-revving nature, and reliability. 
                It features double VANOS (variable valve timing) on both the intake and exhaust camshafts, which helps improve performance and fuel efficiency.
                The ZF5 transmission is a five-speed manual transmission that was used in various BMW models, including the E46 3 Series. 
                It is known for its smooth shifting and durability. The ZF5 transmission features a close-ratio gearset, which helps improve acceleration and overall performance.

                Project Goal: 
            </h2>

            <p>
                The car I will be using is a 2004 330ci, the main goal of this project is to implement a forced induction system to increase 
                the overall power and torque. 
                This will mainly be accomplshed by modifying its original engine (M54) and Transmission (ZF5).
                Other systems will also need to e modified to support this increased power and different intake and exhaust systems
                The forced induction will be provided by a turbocharger increasing the air being fed into the engines intake.
                Turbo's not only help make significant horsepower and torque gains but also improve engine efficiency. 
                The turbocharger is the best value oriented forced induction method as its price to performance ratio is unmacthed. 
                Im aiming to make anywhere from 400-450 whp (wheel horsepower) reliably with this build and have minimal turbo lag.
                That is the sweetspot for it to be able to be street or track driven without making significant compromises.
